    Describe a class where you felt your final grade in a course did not match with what you learned throughout the semester (this could be where your grade was “too low” or “too high”).

    What do you think grades represent? What is your experience with grades?

    If grades were removed from courses, what would you use for motivation? What value would learning have for you without grades?

    Describe a time where you took the “easy way out” for an assignment. Why did you choose to go this route?

I've taken a online class before that was graded mostly on participation in discussion boards.  There was hardly any learning, just reading articles and commenting on them and I also put the bare minimum effort into my discussion posts and comments.  I just made sure to get the required number of posts and comments and I earned an A in the class even though I learned nothing and I could not recall a single thing from the class.  In the other direction, I've also had a class where I knew nothing when I started the class and I learned quite a bit but my grades at the beginning of the semester weighed down my final grade and even though I learned a lot, I started behind so my end knowledge was still below where it should've been to earn a decent grade.

I think grades represent how well you do in comparison to perfection.  I like to have a grade so I can compare where I'm at and where I need to be although I think instead of just averaging grades through the whole semester it should be more of a look at where you started versus where you ended.

I had a class last semester without traditional grading where we had a list of learning targets and we got multiple attempts in quizzes, exams, and projects to show that we mastered the target.  If we mastered the target one time then we got to check off a box on a sheet and we did not need to demonstrate that skill again and there was no way for the check to be taken away.  At the beginning of the semester, the syllabus showed how many earning targets we needed for an A, B, C, or D.  That is what I used for motivation.  Checking off boxes to show what I know how to do.  I think without some kind of visual or some way to gauge learning I would probably fall behind.

I've taken the easy way out with assignments mostly for online classes.  After a full day of in person classes there I times when I am just too exhausted to concentrate on something but I need to turn in something for credit so I just take the easy way out in order to not get a zero.
